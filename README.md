# GAME 2048
My first Javascript Project

# Description: 
This is my very first project using Javascript, html, and css, replicating the famous game 2048. I've also deploy the game on hostman. You can find it here: https://game-2048.hostman.site/

# Table of Contents: 
In the file uploaded you can find a separate zip file that contains all the codes and media files. 

# Installation: 
To install the game, simply install the zip file or download each file separately. Make sure all the files are in the same directory so that they can stay connected when you open the html. After succesfully install all files on your machine, open the html file with your browser to start play!
